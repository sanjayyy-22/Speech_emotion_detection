Speech emotion detection using Machine learning models.

As you all know we can use ML models integrating for speech detections and emotions detections etc.In a similar way, I have done this project detecting the emotion of a audio in .wav file format and I have used RAVDESS dataset from Kaggle and done with that.

I have also done data preprocessing, data visualization,normalization,feature scaling and model selection.

I considered XG boost and Random forests model. Out of which, XG boost model performs better in identifying the emotions according to the listed emotions.

I may extend this project with real time voices and predict immediately with good accuracy performing Deep learning models.
